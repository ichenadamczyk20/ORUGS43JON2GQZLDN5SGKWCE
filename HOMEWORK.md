There is a wav file in carefully-crafted-challenge-content. Use the Steganography tools provided to find what's hidden inside! Hint: stegging the first file will lead you to another file to run steg on.

Caution: pls be wary of listening to the spectrogram audios except at low volumes, since it may be hard to tell if high frequencies specifically you are hearing are too loud for your ears and will cause hearing damage.
