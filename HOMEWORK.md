There is a wav file in carefully-crafted-challenge-content. Use the Steganography tools provided to find what's hidden inside! 

To complete this, you will have to do stuff in Audacity and run four java commands using the java tools in the repo (for one of the steps, you can use an additional java command, but it can also be done using only UNIX commands).

YO MAKE SURE TO NOT DEAFEN YOURSELF IAN TELLS ME THESE AUDIO FILES CAN DO THAT SO

(when you do the audacity spectrogram, pls open the settings and make sure it is set to linear, 1 to 8000 Hz for best results)
