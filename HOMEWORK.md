There is a wav file in carefully-crafted-challenge-content. Use the Steganography tools provided to find what's hidden inside! Hint: stegging the first file will lead you to another file to run steg on.

To complete this, you will have to do stuff in Audacity and run four java commands using the java tools in the repo (one additional java command can also be done using only UNIX commands).

YO MAKE SURE TO NOT DEAFEN YOURSELF IAN TELLS ME THESE AUDIO FILES CAN DO THAT SO

(when you do the audacity spectrogram, pls open the settings and make sure it is set to linear, 1 to 8000 Hz for best results)
