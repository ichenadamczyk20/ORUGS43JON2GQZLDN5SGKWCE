# THE IMPORTANT STUFF
 - Fix ogg stega
 - Check that aiff, wav stega still works
 - Make slides
 - Plan HW

## LESS IMPORTANT STUFF
 - Smoothen out spectro stega
 - Make aiff, wav, and ogg stega not require original file (I talked to Mr. K we might actually lose points over this)
 - Practice presentation together
 - Test HW and make sure it's not too annoying

## KINDA UNIMPORTANT BUT I WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY
 - "Reverse engineer" LAME and design MP3 stega
 - Understand video file formats enough to present on it?
