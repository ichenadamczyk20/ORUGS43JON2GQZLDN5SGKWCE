# Audio Steganography!

## What is Audio Steganography?

Audio Steganography acts in a similar fashion to image steganography - storing data through slightly modifying an audio file to hide data in a way that is undetectable by the human ear. This could be done in a multitude of different types of files, from hiding data in the header of a WAV file to creating images that become visible through applications such as Audacity.

#### Example:

Above was an example of a hidden image of a creeper within the sound files for cave14.ogg, a music file within minecraft.

## Some Uses of Audio Steganography

Audio Steganography has some advantages over Image Steganography. For example, it can be used to spy on a household more stealthily - an Indian advertisement company called SilverPush was able to transmit data from their websites or advertisements on TVs to phones to track usersâ€™ habits. By taking advantage of audio files, the company obtained information it would not have been able to without cameras. 

For a more legal example, Amazon modified its Super Bowl commercial for Alexa to have a code hidden in the advertisement to tell Alexa to not trigger when called on by the ad.

## What Files Store Audio?

Files that are:
  - Under file types: WAV, mp3, aiff, ogg, webm, m4a, flac, etc.
  - Usually at least 1KB, but under 10 MB
tend to contain audio.
