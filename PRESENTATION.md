## What is Audio Steganography?

Audio Steganography acts in a similar fashion to image steganography - storing data through slightly modifying an audio file to hide data in a way that is undetectable by the human ear. This could be done in a multitude of different types of files, from hiding data in the header of a WAV file to creating images that become visible through applications such as Audacity.

#### Example:
