Good job hacker.

You have found the instructions in this git repo's history.

Here is the solution:

make them fix .wav metadata to find artist name
download the track from youtube-dl to compare with the hidden bits data
the hidden bits data is a corrupted png file
they use image steganography on the png file
the png file gives them a url
from the url (google drive, tinyurl)

Bunch of filler files you have to find the one with a specific owner or whatever idk
Vigenere cipher WITH A DIFFERENT DICTIONARY YOU HAVE TO FIND (actually hidden in the original video at the end only on the last frame so you have to steg each frame)
